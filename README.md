# Pong Wars

It's the eternal battle between day and night, good and bad. Written in JavaScript with some HTML & CSS in one index.html. Feel free to reuse the code and create your version.

## Development

Run:

## Credits

I saw this first here: https://twitter.com/nicolasdnl/status/1749715070928433161, but it appears to be a much older idea. There's some more information on the history in the [Hacknernews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39159418).

The colors are based on the Mindful Palette by [Alex Cristache](https://twitter.com/AlexCristache/status/1738610343499157872).

## Submitting PRs

I love getting feedback and PRs with improvements for this, but I also want to keep this simple and the code minimal. If you want to extent the game, feel free to create your own. If you found a way to improve the collision detection (or a better way to add some randomness), feel free to open a PR.
